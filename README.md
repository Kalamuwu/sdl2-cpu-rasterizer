# SDL2 CPU Rasterizer

A very basic rasterizer built on SDL2. Very very basic functionality right now but more will be added as I learn.

### TODO:
- Clipping
- Correct z-indexing
- Models + instancing
- Camera rotation

### WORKS:
- Wireframe (LSHIFT) (as long as the z-index doesnt matter)
- Camera movement (W A S D Q E)
- Filled tris (again, ignoring the z-index)
